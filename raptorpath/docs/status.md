# Status

What ships today, the most recent verdicts, the open debts, and the next
pre-registered measurement. Rules for measuring are in
[measurement-discipline.md](measurement-discipline.md). The full measurement
ledger this replaces is in git history (ledger at ac1aed1).

## 1. The default stack (as the code resolves it)

**Pipeline routing** (`net/mod.rs` `is_window_mode`,
`(hint == Realtime || window_reliable) && backend.is_streaming()`):

| hint | default route | with `--window-reliable` |
|---|---|---|
| Realtime | window pipeline, unified RLC span machine, EVICT retention (ρ < 1) | window pipeline, retain-until-acked (ρ = 1) |
| Auto (the default hint) | **block pipeline**, RaptorQ, block ARQ | window pipeline, RLC auto-selected, retain-until-acked |
| Bulk | **block pipeline**, RaptorQ, block ARQ | as Auto |

`window_reliable` defaults to `false` (`config.rs`) and `fec_backend` to the
block-only RaptorQ; with the backend unset the window pipeline auto-selects RLC.
Pinned by `default_config_routes_bulk_and_auto_to_the_block_pipeline` (ADR-0069).

**Wire and substrate.** `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 8`; compact DATA framing
(`RWM_WIRE_COMPACT`) on. Substrate congestion control is quinn BBR
(`RWM_QUIC_CC`, default `bbr`). The wire-clocked Copa signal and Copa pacing
are off unless `RWM_QUIC_CC=passthrough`, `RWM_COPA_FEED` or `RWM_COPA_WIRE`
is set.

**Gates on by default** (`gates.rs` `RuntimeGates::resolve`, plus the
resolve-once sites it names): `RWM_UNIFIED`, `RWM_UNIFIED_SHED`,
`RWM_TAPER_R`, `RWM_ASTAR_ANCHOR`, `RWM_MSTAR_ANCHOR`, `RWM_HONEST_ANCHOR`,
`RWM_STORE_SACK_RELEASE`, `RWM_STORE_PATHS`,
`RWM_HONEST_CAP`, `RWM_GEN_PIPE` (only reached when generation is on),
`RWM_RS_ATTR`, `RWM_RECOV_MP`, `RWM_RECOV_MP_LAW`, `RWM_SUM_CAP`,
`RWM_DELTA_CAP`, `RWM_ACK_MERGE`, `RWM_WIRE_COMPACT`.

Every other `RWM_*` gate is off by default (an experiment arm or an
instrument). Store gain 2.0, store boot 128 and the per-path pool 2048 are the
shipped store constants (§3.4).

## 2. Most recent verdicts

| measurement | design | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Attribution audit (D0) | 4 cells, 3 reps, 12 invocations | `orig_frac` averages two mechanisms: true-heal share π0 is 0.0077 (c1) and 0.0054 (sc2) at single paths, 0.96 (c7) and 0.92 (c8) at duals |
| Crown no-regression spot (wire v8 merges) | tail_matrix `ship`, realtime, c2/c3, 400/1200 B, ×8, seeds 42+7 | Repairs inert on the crown at 7 of 8 cell-size-seeds; c3·400B seed 7 p99 median outside by 0.2 ms, at the pre-declared era-limited cell; the EVICT seat answers 1.8–3.1 repairs per abandoned hole, and 82–99 % of abandoned holes get their data after the give-up |
| r > 0 battery (Track B) | seed 42, n = 4 (truncated by the 5 h cap) | Glide R-FUNDED-NEGATIVE (direction only) at the lossy single; MID `VOID` by W7; entanglement-dominated where scoreable; control confirmed at the corner |
| Receiver-law battery (Track C) | n = 3 × 2 seeds | `REFUTED-WITH-RECORD` on every arm at both duals; KNEE-BOUND (ℓ* = 0, names `RWM_STORE_GAIN`); `CONTROL-MOVED` at c1; sc2 substrate collapsed |
| Placement battery (Track A) | n = 4 × 2 seeds | First readout MIXED: cross-path wait ≈ 6 % of delivered latency, queueing above the path floor the largest term; all arms `INERT-AS-DERIVED` on latency, goodput regressions under the guard; 0.15 is not a stable quantile |

The last three rows are the law-search batteries (the ledger's "Stage 2"). Their
conclusion: a latency win must come from the store/pacing law that
owns the queue, not from placement; the next law to derive is that one, and the
next measurement is its decomposition. No default flipped and no constant was
blessed.

## 3. Open items and debts

### 3.1 Instrument and substrate findings owed from the law-search batteries

1. The receiver's self-heal estimator (`succ.rs`) counts the sender's retransmit as a self-heal, so π̂0 ≈ 1; fix before any receiver-side law is re-tested.
2. sc2 (clean 100 Mbit single path) did not finish 100 MB in 300 s on the shipped window machine (6/6, 8/8; ~2 Mbit/s once); bisect against the crown era.
3. The sender `[ETA]` has no exit flush; `eta_s4.py` uses RTprop where the law uses SRTT (routes disagree 3–4×); the σ̂ witness fails at c7/sc3.
4. c8 control shows a bimodal fast-path-alone collapse (4/8 reps), outside every pre-registered set; the likely source of c8's 75 % CV.
5. `RWM_COPA_DELTA` has no engine echo, so MID cannot be scored again.
6. `tracing` interleaves records onto readout lines; the diagnostic writer needs a newline discipline.
7. `r_report.py` does not propagate a W7 `VOID`, and its R-FUNDED-NEGATIVE branch fires on any null.

### 3.2 Generation-coding stack: no disposition

`--window-generation-coding` (with DAPS, the rate-sample estimator, `RWM_GEN*`,
`RWM_OOO_RETAIN`) is opt-in, never default, and has no keep-or-remove decision.

### 3.3 NO-MODE-SWITCH debts (hint- or ρ-keyed code paths)

Each is a behaviour step at a preset point, which CLAUDE.md forbids.

| site | what it switches |
|---|---|
| `net/mod.rs` `is_window_mode` | the block/window pipeline fork (Bulk/Auto vs Realtime); §4 decides it |
| `net/emit_source.rs` (`protocol_hint == Realtime`) | Realtime duplicate source send, a redundancy decision priced by nothing |
| `net/sender_policy.rs` `use_packing` | symbol packing on Realtime only |
| `scheduler/mod.rs` `queue_target_mult` | Copa queue target 1.08 / 1.125 / 1.25 by hint |
| `scheduler/mod.rs` `copa_compete_active` (`RWM_COPA_COMPETE`) | Copa's TCP-competitive mode switching |
| `reliable` boolean branches in the window sender/receiver | ρ = 1 vs ρ < 1 selecting code paths instead of composing with δ |

### 3.4 Open-constants register

All unprovenanced and uncorrected (correct value unknown). Source: paper §11.2.

| constant | value | where | why unprovenanced |
|---|---|---|---|
| tail-sweep / refresh clamp | `(2·srtt).clamp(25, 100) ms` | `net/mod.rs` `hole_nack_refresh` | undefeated, not derived; derivable from true-heal F only at duals |
| legacy age gate | `srtt/2` | `net/mod.rs` `legacy_age_ripe` | pre-RFC; compares flight age with a dwell-inclusive srtt; inert at c1 |
| RECOV_MP thresholds | `9/8·max(srtt, ewma)`, 3 packets | `net/mod.rs` `mp_time_threshold_split` | RFC 9002 values applied to an age that includes sender dwell |
| `GAP_ACK_MIN_INTERVAL` | 2 ms | `net/mod.rs` | a rate limit that is also the hole sampler; not derived |
| `NACK_RETX_COOLDOWN_FLOOR_US` | 10 ms | `net/mod.rs` | 10× kGranularity by choice; moves W by 6.8× across its range |
| `ELIGIBLE_SKEW` | 75 ms | `scheduler/mod.rs` | a threshold that selects a code path |
| taper copy `p_lost` | model-derived | `net/emit_source.rs` | measured waste is zero; why it never fires is undecided |
| store gain / recovery round | 2.0 / 100 ms | `gates.rs`, `net/mod.rs` | the headroom H is proportional to gain − 1; κ is a fit |
| heal/closed classifier | `srtt/2` | D0 instrument | biases π0 upward; gates nothing |
| `PLACE_TEMPERATURE` | 0.15 | `scheduler/mod.rs` | argmax of a four-point sweep whose verdict failed |
| `w_div` | 1.0 | `SchedulingWeights::from_hint` | derived GE form gives 0.475 (c2) / 0.552 (c3) |
| unmeasured-path price | 10.0 | `scheduler/mod.rs` `place_costs` | a hard exclusion (e^−66 odds) in a continuous costume |
| near-tie band / floor | 0.8 / 0.25 | `place_repair_spare_path` | a relative band plus an absolute floor: a missing scale |
| stall fraction κ in placement | 1 | `place_costs` | declared upper bound; measured 0.005–0.067 |
| `BULK_TAIL_BUDGET` | 0.05 | `raptorpath-math` | an "e.g." in the derivation promoted to a const |
| `queue_target_mult` | 1.08 / 1.125 / 1.25 | `scheduler/mod.rs` | declared corner; no continuous form fits the three points |
| block shape by hint | `BlockProfile::from_hint`, interleave 2/1/3 | `net/mod.rs`, `config.rs` | declared corners; interleave is non-monotone in δ |
| Realtime duplicate send | on at Realtime | `net/emit_source.rs` | a rate decision taken by a hint equality |
| `use_packing` | on at Realtime | `net/sender_policy.rs` | declared corner |
| receiver hold | `(4·srtt).clamp(60, 300) ms`; armed arm `srtt/2` | `net/mod.rs` `shed_recv_hold` | three constants; `srtt/2` equals b(δ_Realtime) by seat, not by evaluation |

## 4. Block default re-test — pre-registration

Discharges ADR-0069's re-test clause. Committed before VM contact; no number
below is a result. Binary: `main` with the cleanup's bug fixes (including the
recovery-clock saturation-set fix) and refuted-arm removal merged, built fresh
on the VM, `sha256` recorded.

**Deviations from ADR-0069 part 4.** Today's harness cells replace C1–C5
(`perf_native.sh` cannot run duals); reps are cut for the 5 h cap; the rule is
"window not worse", so ADR-0069's C2 reversal clause (b) is not adopted (the
owner's decision: the one-machine design wins a tie).

**Arms** (interleaved within each rep, one binary, fresh topology per
invocation, driver `tools/l1/perf_rwm_c.sh`):
- `BLK` — the default: no `--window-reliable`, backend unset (block, RaptorQ).
- `WIN` — `--window-reliable`, backend unset (RLC), `RWM_GEN=0` (plain
  reliable window, generation off).

Setup owed before the VM, in its own commit: (a) a `perf_rwm_c.sh` switch that
drops `--window-reliable` and the generation flag for `BLK`; (b) a one-line
engine echo of the resolved pipeline and backend on both endpoints
(`pipeline=block backend=RaptorQ` / `pipeline=window backend=Rlc`) with a unit
test. Without (b) the witness is the presence/absence of the "reliable window
mode … auto-selecting RLC" line, which is one-sided and is recorded as weaker.

*Amendment (harness facts, no change to arms, cells or outcomes):* the switch
in (a) is implemented as `RWM_C_PIPELINE=block|window` on `perf_rwm_c.sh`
(default `window`); `block` drops `--window-reliable` and the generation flag,
and the `--- RWM-C perf` header line prints `pipeline=<arm>`. `c8` below always
means the 25 MB dual; the placement battery's 100 MB dual of the same geometry
is named `c8L`. `perf_native.sh`, named in the deviations above, was deleted
in 639929c; `RWM_C_PIPELINE=block` is the block driver.

**Hints**: `bulk`, `auto`. **Seeds**: 42, 7. **Cells** (`lib.sh
scenario_params`; duals as in `perf_rwm_c.sh`):

| cell | geometry | size | shaped capacity |
|---|---|---|---|
| c1 | single, 1 Gbit, 1 ms one-way, GE 0.05/50 | 400 MB | 1000 Mbit |
| c2 | single, 100 Mbit, 5 ms, jitter 3, GE 1.3/50 | 100 MB | 100 Mbit |
| c3 | single, 20 Mbit, 20 ms, jitter 5, GE 2/40 | 25 MB | 20 Mbit |
| c7 | dual c2 ‖ c2 | 200 MB | 200 Mbit |
| c8 | dual c2 ‖ c3 | 25 MB | 120 Mbit |

`RWM_PERF_TIMEOUT_S=150` (at least 4× every cell's nominal transfer time); a
run past it is a DNF. `RWM_DIAG=1` on both arms.

**Budget.** 2 arms × 2 hints × 5 cells = 20 invocations per rep. Measured
cost is ~1.8–3.6 min per invocation (placement battery 1.81 min; r battery
3.59 min). n = 4 per seed (160 invocations, 290–580 min) does not fit, so
**n is cut to 3 per seed**: 120 invocations, ~220 min at 1.8 min. Plus build,
CR check and smoke (~25 min) and the crown spot below (~33 min): ~280 min.
If the smoke's measured cost `c` gives `120·c` above the time left, n per seed
becomes `floor(time_left / (40·c))` before launch, minimum 2, and is written
into an amendment commit. A detached stopper ends the battery at a balanced
rep boundary or at 5 h. Order: crown spot, then seed 42 reps 1–3, then seed 7.

**Witnesses per invocation, both endpoints**: the pipeline echo matches the
arm; `[GATES]` present with `RWM_GEN=0` (the smoke confirms the block path
prints it); `BLK` shows no window/RLC line, `WIN`
shows it; a `"summary"` line (else `NO_DATA`); `sha256` unchanged.

**Scored** per (cell, hint), pooled over seeds and also per seed:
- goodput: whole-transfer mean per run (`mbps` = bytes·8 / seconds), median
  and [min–max] over reps;
- completion time p50 over completed reps;
- DNF count.

**Outcomes** (no other verdict may be recorded):
- **`WINDOW-NOT-WORSE`** ⇔ at every (cell, hint), pooled and on each seed:
  `WIN` median goodput ≥ `BLK` minimum goodput (at or above the bottom of
  `BLK`'s own spread), `WIN` completion p50 ≤ `BLK` maximum completion, and
  `WIN` DNF ≤ `BLK` DNF (where `BLK` completed no rep, the completion clause
  is vacuous and the DNF clause decides). Then flip the default and delete
  block mode per ADR-0069 Appendix A (make `is_window_mode` unconditional, default backend
  RLC, block fallback becomes a config error, update the routing pin).
- **`BLOCK-BETTER-AT-<cell>`** ⇔ any of those three clauses fails at that
  cell for either hint. Stop: block stays the default, the cell, hint and
  numbers are recorded here, and the one-machine claim names the exception.
- **`UNSCOREABLE`** ⇔ fewer than 2 live reps per seed at any (cell, hint,
  arm) after aborts and voids, a failed witness on ≥ 2 reps of an arm-cell,
  or any of the first five abort causes below firing.

**Abort causes, in priority order**: `ABORT-LOCK` (either lock), `ABORT-CRLF`
(`lib.sh` not 0 CR bytes), `ABORT-SHA` (binary changed), `ABORT-SENTINEL-UNWRITABLE`
(probed at launch), `ABORT-SMOKE` (one invocation per arm at c2 and c8, bulk,
seed 42, must show every witness; nothing in it is a result), `ABORT-RC`
(non-zero driver exit: that invocation's rows are void, the battery goes on),
`ABORT-BRINGUP` (retries exhausted: `NO_DATA`, not an abort of the battery).

**Stated in advance.** Finding 3.1.2 (sc2 did not finish 100 MB in 300 s on
the shipped window machine) predicts that `WIN` at c2 may DNF or run far below
line rate. If so, the reading is `BLOCK-BETTER-AT-c2`, and the finding moves
from "substrate" to "the window pipeline" at that cell. c2 and c3 have run at
~100 % of shaped capacity on earlier binaries, so neither arm can gain goodput
there (MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE 16); a loss is still visible, which is all a
not-worse rule needs.

**Crown no-regression spot, same session** (for the recovery-clock
saturation-set fix, which changes the default path): `tools/l1/tail_matrix.sh`
arm `ship` (env unset), hint `realtime`, no `--window-reliable`, cells c2 and
c3, sizes 400 B and 1200 B, ×8 reps, seeds 42 and 7, 50 msg/s × 20 s. Passes
(`REPAIRS-INERT-ON-CROWN`) iff, per cell-size-seed, the p99 median lies inside
the union of the committed spreads (the wire-v8 spot's [min–max] joined with
the older baselines: c2·400B [34–199] s42, [34–56] s7; c2·1200B [35–57] s42,
[35–169] s7; c3·400B [87–154] s42, [88.5–297] s7; c3·1200B [84.3–175] s42,
[90.8–139.1] s7), the p50 median lies in 7.0–9.0 ms (c2) or 22.0–27.0 ms (c3),
and `count = 1000` in ≥ 62 of 64 reps with none below 995. Otherwise
`CROWN-MOVED(cell, seed, metric, direction)`; an improvement also counts as
moved. Fewer than 6 of 8 reps with a summary at any cell-size-seed is
`SPOT-UNSCOREABLE`.

**Result**: not yet run. The scored result is recorded here.
